‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä<img src="Proj/BG/BGB/a.PNG" height="20"> that the model <img src="Proj/BG/BGG/b.PNG" height="20"> also the model now up-scaled a little bit, so it wont kinda look <img src="Proj/BG/e.PNG" height="20">

**2. No More Annoyying Long Hand!**

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ÄYep, das right.. In this update i bring up some fixes on the First Person Perspective that <img src="Proj/BG/BGB/ba.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/BGB/bb.PNG" height="20"> that may decrease your experience while using this add-on.

‚†ÄThat‚Äôs it.. <img src="Proj/BG/fa.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/fb.PNG" height="20">! I just highlight some of the Important changes on this update.

‚†ÄPssSsTsTSTsstTS! <img src="Proj/BG/BGR/ba.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/BGR/bb.PNG" height="20"> so <img src="Proj/BG/ga.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/gb.PNG" height="20">

<img src="Proj/BG/BGR/c.PNG" height="30">

‚†Ä‚†Ä1. At the first variant, you‚Äôll see that its just a usual mother Russia sized man. Nothing scared about him, right? 

![](https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/2975/images/mcos--putimir-vladin_12.png)

‚†Ä‚†ÄThe normal one will called as‚Ä¶ <img src="Proj/BG/BGB/c.PNG" height="20"> off course, just choose to the Normal one using the Texture Pack Slider to get this variant. Its has less vertices than the other variants, so it‚Äôll more faster to load when you applying this on the Resource pack. Its just scaled into 0.545√ó0.545√ó0.545 in order to fit the height of Minecraft Normal  Skin Character.

‚†Ä‚†Ä2. The second one, Is the Wide one. This is variant is heavily based on the original meme and its just <img src="Proj/BG/h.PNG" height="20">

![](https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/2975/images/mcos--putimir-vladin_14.png)

‚†ÄCome to the Wide one, its has dozens of vertices that may slowdown the loading time. The model stretched to the X-axis and the scale is made to be closest to the Original Putin Walk Meme. This variant named as ‚Äú<img src="Proj/BG/BGG/b.PNG" height="20">‚Äú, <img src="Proj/BG/ia.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/ib.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/ic.PNG" height="20"> üòÄ

![](https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/2975/images/mcos--putimir-vladin_15.png)

‚†Ä‚†Ä3. The third one, is the Wide variant but the wide is reversed to the front (<img src="Proj/BG/BGG/c.PNG" height="20"> )

![](https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/2975/images/mcos--putimir-vladin_16.png)

‚†ÄAs i said earlier, its just reversed Wide putin but the Wide is scaled to the Front wich is Y-axis. The scale is still the same though, its has 0.545x1x2.157 scale form. You can find this at the texture pack, just find ‚Äú<img src="Proj/BG/BGB/e.PNG" height="20">‚Äù to select this variant. <img src="Proj/BG/ka.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/kb.PNG" height="20">

<img src="Proj/BG/BGR/d.PNG" height="30">

‚†ÄWelcome to the Cursed Area! Here‚Äôfore‚Äôs already cursed but do you want some more? I have more Explicit content for you! Here we have 2 other variants that willn‚Äôt regret you at first (<img src="Proj/BG/BGG/da.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/BGG/db.PNG" height="20">). *<img src="Proj/BG/BGO/a.PNG" height="20">*

**1. Wide Putimir but More Wider to the Front!**

‚†ÄWell, its just wide Putimir but the scale reversed into the front! You can call it ‚Äú<img src="Proj/BG/BGG/e.PNG" height="20">‚Äú. <img src="Proj/BG/la.PNG" height="20"><img src="Proj/BG/lb.PNG" height="20">

![](https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/2975/images/mcos--putimir-vladin_18.png)

‚†ÄThe ‚ÄúMore Wide‚Äù variant has more vertices than the ‚ÄúUsual Wide‚Äù variant. It may really slowdown the Loading time, just be patient when loading any of these.

‚†ÄSince the MCPEDL Team requires me to provide more detailed description, well i‚Äôll definitely gives that!. You can find this variant as ‚Äú<img src="Proj/BG/BGB/f.PNG" height="20">‚Äù at the resource file, its done by stretching more wildly to Y-axis. Its scaled with 9.017 values to the Y-axis to achieve this kind of Man!

‚†Ä<img src="Proj/BG/BGDR/a.PNG" height="20">, This variant has alot of uses in the game! <img src="Proj/BG/n.PNG" height="20"> for Example. You can find this Monstrosity Model as ‚Äú<img src="Proj/BG/BGB/g.PNG" height="20">‚Äù because i named it like that :v. Made by scaling the X-axis with the same value as before (9.017) in order to achieve this.
