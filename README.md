⠀⠀⠀Bored with usual Minecraft? No Worries, you can try this <img src="Proj/BG/a.PNG" width="88"> …Addon! It will gives you a meme vibe inside the pixellated Minecraft! Its inspired by walking WIDE Putin ( I have no idea why i got some inspiration by just a person walking through the hallway). Putting memes in to your Minecraft isnt bad right? <img src="Proj/BG/b.PNG" width="115"> :D.

⠀⠀⠀Scared that you’re going to Gulag? Just dont be that scared, its just a cloned version of “”Him””. I call the cloned one as “<img src="Proj/BG/BGG/a.PNG" width="110">" and he is good at walking!
